## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In order to install and use _qu_, you need the following languages and
tools installed:

* [Java](http://www.java.com/en/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
* [MongoDB 2.6+](http://www.mongodb.org/)


### Setup

Once you have the prerequisites installed and the code downloaded and
expanded into a directory (which we will call "qu"), run the following
commands:

```sh
cd qu
lein deps
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
npm install && bower install
grunt
```

To start a Clojure REPL to work with the software, run:

```sh
lein repl
```

In order to run the API as a web server, run:

```sh
lein run
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000> and you should see the app running.

Before starting the API, you will want to start MongoDB and load some
data into it. Currently, _qu_ only supports connecting to a local
MongoDB connection.

### Loading data

Make sure you have MongoDB started. To load some sample data, run
`lein repl` and enter the following:

```clojure
(require 'qu.loader)
(in-ns 'qu.loader)
(mongo/connect!)
(load-dataset "county_taxes")
(load-dataset "census") ; Takes quite a while to run; can skip.
(mongo/disconnect!)
```

You can find out more about loading your own data in the
[publishing data](data_publishing.html) section.
